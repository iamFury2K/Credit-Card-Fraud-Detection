# Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

This repository contains a Python implementation of anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The Isolation Forest is a popular method for identifying anomalies in datasets, particularly in cases where the anomalies are rare and have different statistical properties from the normal data.

## Introduction

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected behavior. This project demonstrates how to use the Isolation Forest algorithm to perform anomaly detection. It includes synthetic data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-isolation-forest.git

Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd anomaly-detection-isolation-forest
```

Install the required Python packages (it's recommended to use a virtual environment):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and see how the Isolation Forest algorithm performs anomaly detection on synthetic data.
